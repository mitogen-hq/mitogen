# When running the tests outside CI, make a single 'target' host which is the
# local machine. The ansible_user override is necessary since some tests want a
# fixed ansible.cfg remote_user setting to test against.
# FIXME Hardcoded by replacement in some CI runs https://github.com/mitogen-hq/mitogen/issues/1022
#       and os.environ['USER'] is not populated on Azure macOS runners.
