# Verify action plugins still set file modes correctly even though
# fixup_perms2() avoids setting execute bit despite being asked to.
# As of Ansible 2.10.0, default perms vary based on OS. On debian systems it's 0644 and on centos it's 0664 based on test output
# regardless, we're testing that no execute bit is set here so either check is ok
