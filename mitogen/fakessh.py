"""
:mod:`mitogen.fakessh` is a stream implementation that starts a subprocess with
its environment modified such that ``PATH`` searches for `ssh` return a Mitogen
implementation of SSH. When invoked, this implementation arranges for the
command line supplied by the caller to be executed in a remote context, reusing
the parent context's (possibly proxied) connection to that remote context.

This allows tools like `rsync` and `scp` to transparently reuse the connections
and tunnels already established by the host program to connect to a target
machine, without wasteful redundant SSH connection setup, 3-way handshakes, or
firewall hopping configurations, and enables these tools to be used in
impossible scenarios, such as over `sudo` with ``requiretty`` enabled.

The fake `ssh` command source is written to a temporary file on disk, and
consists of a copy of the :py:mod:`mitogen.core` source code (just like any
other child context), with a line appended to cause it to connect back to the
host process over an FD it inherits. As there is no reliance on an existing
filesystem file, it is possible for child contexts to use fakessh.

As a consequence of connecting back through an inherited FD, only one SSH
invocation is possible, which is fine for tools like `rsync`, however in future
this restriction will be lifted.

Sequence:

    1. ``fakessh`` Context and Stream created by parent context. The stream's
       buffer has a :py:func:`_fakessh_main` :py:data:`CALL_FUNCTION
       <mitogen.core.CALL_FUNCTION>` enqueued.
    2. Target program (`rsync/scp/sftp`) invoked, which internally executes
       `ssh` from ``PATH``.
    3. :py:mod:`mitogen.core` bootstrap begins, recovers the stream FD
       inherited via the target program, established itself as the fakessh
       context.
    4. :py:func:`_fakessh_main` :py:data:`CALL_FUNCTION
       <mitogen.core.CALL_FUNCTION>` is read by fakessh context,

        a. sets up :py:class:`IoPump` for stdio, registers
           control_handle and stdin_handle for local context.
        b. Enqueues :py:data:`CALL_FUNCTION <mitogen.core.CALL_FUNCTION>` for
           :py:func:`_start_slave` invoked in target context,

            i. the program from the `ssh` command line is started
            ii. sets up :py:class:`IoPump` for `ssh` command line process's
                stdio pipes
            iii. returns `(control_handle, stdin_handle)` to
                 :py:func:`_fakessh_main`

    5. :py:func:`_fakessh_main` receives control/stdin handles from from
       :py:func:`_start_slave`,

        a. registers remote's control_handle and stdin_handle with local
           :py:class:`IoPump`.
        b. sends `("start", ())` to remote's control_handle to start receiving
           stdout from remote subprocess
        c. registers local :py:class:`IoPump` with
           :py:class:`mitogen.core.Broker` to start sending stdin to remote
           subprocess
        d. forwards _on_stdin data to stdout with IoPump.write and IoPump.close
        e. loops waiting for `("exit", status)` control message from slave
           and for pending writes to stdout to complete.

    6. :py:func:`_start_slave` control channel receives `("start", ())`,

        a. registers local :py:class:`IoPump` with
           :py:class:`mitogen.core.Broker` to start receiving and forwarding
           subprocess stdout
        b. forwards _on_stdin data to subprocess stdin with IoPump.write and
           IoPump.close
        c. shuts down and sends `("exit", status)` control message to master
           after reaching EOF from subprocess stdout

    "stdin" handle and handler naming is a little misleading because they are
    used to forard stdin data from the master to the slave, but stdout data from
    the slave to the master

    - Forwarding data from IoPump.write() and IoPump.close() calls to protocol
      transmit api

    Overrides default protocol on_disconnect and on_shutdown methods, only
    closing the receive side when an on_disconnect EOF is reached, and only
    closing the transmit side when close() is called or on_shutdown termination
    is forced. This way when EOF is reached for receiving data, outgoing data is
    still transmitted in full without being truncated, and vice versa.

    Back pressure is implemented in the receive direction ('receive' listeners
    can block) but no back pressure exists in transmit direction (IoPump.write
    and IoPump.close calls never block), so writing data too fast can use an
    unbounded amount of memory.

    The lack of back pressure for writes should not normally be problem when
    IoPump is used by fakessh, because the data should be coming in from a slow
    remote source and being transmitted to a fast local process. But there could
    be cases where the local process is too slow (maybe writing to a slow disk)
    and memory usage gets out of hand. In this case some kind of blocking or
    rate limiting may need to be implemented for IoPump.write.
